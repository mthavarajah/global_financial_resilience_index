        "GDP per capita is a comprehensive measure of people's average income. It helps compare income levels across countries and track how they change over time. It is especially useful for understanding trends in economic growth and living standards.",
        "GDP per capita is calculated as the value of all final goods and services produced each year in a country (the [gross domestic product](#dod:gdp)), divided by the population. It represents the average economic output per person.",
        "This indicator shows the large inequality between people in different countries. In the poorest countries, average incomes are below $1,000 per year; in rich countries, they are more than 50 times higher.",
        "This data comes from the [Maddison Project Database](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2023), which provides GDP per capita estimates for the _very long run_. Some country series extend as far back as 1 CE, and regional estimates start in 1820.",
        "This work builds on the efforts of many researchers who have carefully reconstructed historical data on economic growth and population for individual countries. You can find the full list of sources in [the original dataset](https://dataverse.nl/api/access/datafile/421302).",
        "This data is expressed in constant international dollars at 2011 prices to adjust for inflation and differences in living costs between countries. Read more in our article, [What are international dollars?](https://ourworldindata.org/international-dollars)",
        "This dataset combines multiple [purchasing power parity](#dod:purchasing-power-parity) (PPP) benchmarks to ensure historical consistency and comparability over time. 1990 PPPs are used up to 1990, and 2011 PPPs are used from 2011 onward. For the years in between, they adjust the series to smoothly connect the two benchmarks. This approach preserves consistency with the original long-run estimates calculated by Angus Maddison.",
        "Time series for former countries and territories are calculated forward by estimating values based on their last official borders.",
